## Hello! Nice to meet you!ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Emmeline. I'm currently a student in Taylor's University taking Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours).

I am new to GitHub and I hope to gain new knowledge through this platform. I'm hoping to learn more about coding and also do more projects in the future. I'm currently learning Python.
